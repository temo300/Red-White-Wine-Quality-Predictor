# Red-White-Wine-Quality-Predictor
Trying to predict wine quality given 11 predictors using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), 
Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

For this report we will be examining two data sets for white and red wine quality.

The primary goal of the report is to analyze how the 11 different predictors recorded in 
the wine making process affected the quality of wine. 

This data was used by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. in an
attempt to model wine preferences by data mining from physiochemical properties. Both 
their project and ours aim to predict good wine. However, theirs takes a subjective 
approach, whereas ours takes an objective approach. These two projects complement each 
other because one can compare both the personal preference of one's tastebuds along 
with the standard definition of high quality wine.

Both sets of data contain the same 12 inputs, 11 predictors and 1 response variable. 
The original response variable quality is later transformed to a variable responding 
to "Yes" if quality is greater than or equal to 7 and "No" if quality is less than 7.
